# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **AI Crash Course** repository - a curated educational resource designed to help busy builders catch up to the public frontier of AI research in 2 weeks. It's a fork of Henry Shi's original work and serves as a comprehensive reading list and learning path for AI fundamentals.

## Repository Structure

This is a documentation-focused repository containing:
- **README.md**: The main course curriculum with structured learning paths
- **CNAME**: GitHub Pages configuration for hosting at a custom domain
- **LICENSE**: MIT license for the repository

## Content Organization

The README.md serves as the primary curriculum and is organized into several key sections:

### Learning Path Structure
1. **Foundation**: Neural Network to LLM video series
2. **Survey Papers**: Broad overviews of LLM, Agent, and Prompt Engineering research
3. **Research Papers**: Organized by topic areas:
   - **Foundational Modelling** (Transformers, GPT-3, RLHF, etc.)
   - **Planning/Reasoning** (CoT, ReACT, DeepSeek R1, etc.)
   - **Applications** (Toolformer, Llama3, SWE-Agent, etc.)
   - **Benchmarks** (BIG-Bench, SWE-Bench, Chatbot Arena)
4. **Supplementary Resources**: Videos, websites, and additional learning materials

### Key Features
- Papers are prioritized with star (*) ratings for essential reading
- Chronological organization showing evolution of AI research (2017-2025)
- Mix of foundational theory and practical applications
- Focus on both model development and real-world deployment

## Common Tasks

Since this is a documentation repository, typical tasks involve:
- **Content Updates**: Adding new papers, resources, or reorganizing sections
- **Link Maintenance**: Ensuring all arXiv links and external resources remain accessible
- **Curriculum Enhancement**: Expanding learning paths or adding new topic areas
- **Format Improvements**: Enhancing readability and organization

## Working with the Content

When updating the curriculum:
- Maintain the chronological flow within each section
- Use the star (*) system consistently for priority marking
- Keep the balance between theory and practical applications
- Ensure new additions fit the "2-week crash course" scope and difficulty level
- Follow the existing markdown formatting patterns for consistency

## Repository Context

This repository is hosted on GitHub Pages and serves as an educational resource for the AI community. Changes should focus on improving the learning experience while maintaining the curated, high-quality nature of the content.
