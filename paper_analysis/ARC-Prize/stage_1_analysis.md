### Based on the technical report provided, here are the key insights, surprising elements, and notable quotes



### Key Insights


- ARC-AGI remains an extremely challenging benchmark for measuring general artificial intelligence, as the state-of-the-art score only increased from 33% to 55.5% after a global competition with substantial prizes.

- The rise of large language models and scaling up of deep learning systems from 2020 to 2024 did not lead to significant progress on ARC-AGI, suggesting limitations in the ability of these approaches to tackle novel tasks without training data.

- New techniques like deep learning-guided program synthesis and test-time training enabled some progress, but a substantial gap remains in achieving human-level performance on the benchmark.

- The ARC-AGI benchmark challenges conventional thinking by focusing on generalization to novel tasks, rather than performance on tasks with available training data.

- The competition highlights the importance of open sharing of ideas and techniques to drive progress towards artificial general intelligence.


### Surprising or Shocking Elements


- Despite the widespread adoption of large language models and scaling up of deep learning systems, these approaches performed poorly on ARC-AGI, with the original GPT-3 model scoring 0% on the public evaluation set.

- The top score of 55.5% on the private evaluation set was achieved by a team (MindsAI) that chose not to open-source their solution, potentially hindering progress in the field.

- Even after multiple competitions and substantial prize incentives, the state-of-the-art score on ARC-AGI remains far below human-level performance (97-98% on the original private evaluation tasks).


### Notable Quotes


- "ARC-AGI has resisted the rise of LLMs in the 2022-2024 period."

- "Our view is that progress towards AGI had stalled during this period – AI systems had been getting bigger and memorizing ever more training data, but generality in frontier AI systems had been roughly static."

- "ARC-AGI has been the target of three public competitions before ARC Prize 2024... The first ARC-AGI competition ran on Kaggle in 2020 (9) with a top score of 20%. Four years later, the top score had only increased to 33%."

- "The defining characteristic of the benchmark is that it should not be possible to prepare for any of the tasks in advance. Every task in the dataset follows a different logic."

- "ARC Prize incentivizes and promotes open sharing."
