### Based on the document provided, here are the key insights, surprising elements, and notable quotes



### Key Insights


- Prompt engineering is an emerging field, and there is a lack of standardized terminology and ontological understanding of what constitutes an effective prompt. This paper aims to establish a structured understanding by assembling a taxonomy of prompting techniques.

- The paper presents a detailed vocabulary of 33 prompting terms, a taxonomy of 58 language model prompting techniques, and 40 techniques for other modalities such as images, audio, and video.

- The paper provides best practices and guidelines for prompt engineering, including advice for prompting engineering with ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art language models.

- A meta-analysis of the literature on natural language prefix-prompting is presented, highlighting techniques such as in-context learning, thought generation, decomposition, ensembling, and self-criticism.

- The paper discusses extensions of prompting, including agents (tool use agents, code-generation agents, observation-based agents, and retrieval augmented generation), and evaluation methodologies for prompting techniques and output formats.


### Surprising or Shocking Elements


- The paper mentions the possibility of "prompt hacking," where malicious actors could manipulate prompts to elicit harmful or undesirable responses from language models, posing security risks.

- The paper highlights the issue of "prompt sensitivity," where slight variations in prompts can lead to significant differences in model outputs, raising concerns about the reliability and robustness of language models.

- The paper discusses the potential for language models to exhibit biases, stereotypes, and cultural insensitivities through their responses, which could be amplified or influenced by the prompts used.


### Notable Quotes


- "Empirically, better prompts lead to improved results across a wide range of tasks (Wei et al., 2022b; Liu et al., 2023b; Schulhoff, 2022)."

- "Knowing how to effectively structure, evaluate, and perform other tasks with prompts is essential to using these models."

- "We expect this to be the first iteration of terminologies that will develop over time."

- "Prompt engineering is a widely adopted and extensively researched area, it suffers from conflicting terminology and a fragmented ontological understanding of what constitutes an effective prompt due to its relatively recent emergence."

- "We maintain an up-to-date list of terms and techniques at LearnPrompting.org."
