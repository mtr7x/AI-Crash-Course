Here's a summary capturing the style and perspective of Swyx (Shawn Wang) on the paper "The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompt Engineering Techniques":

TL;DR - The prompt engineering landscape is exploding, and this survey aims to bring some order to the chaos. As developers, we desperately need a shared vocabulary and taxonomy to make sense of all the prompt techniques out there.

The big trend is that prompting has gone fully mainstream - it's how we interact with modern AI like ChatGPT. But the field is still the Wild West with inconsistent terminology and everyone rolling their own prompting methods.

For the dev community, having a systematic way to discuss, compare and reuse prompt engineering techniques is a gamechanger. We can finally start to build on each other's work instead of reinventing the wheel.

The paper catalogues a dizzying 58 distinct text prompting techniques like in-context learning, chain-of-thought, and decomposition. It covers multimodal prompting for images/audio/video too. There are also sections on evaluating prompts, security considerations like "prompt hacking", and benchmarking different approaches.

My key takeaways:
1) Study the prompt engineering taxonomy to level up your prompting skills
2) Experiment with the different techniques on your own use cases 
3) Discuss/debate/extend the terminology - this is still very early!

Prompting is a quintessential developer skill for the AI era. This survey is a great start towards turning it into an established discipline and sharing best practices. I'm excited to see the ecosystem thinking and tooling that emerges from collaborative prompting!
