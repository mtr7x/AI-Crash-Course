### Key Insights


a) Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for achieving human-level intelligence, leading to a surge in research on LLM-based autonomous agents that can make human-like decisions.

b) Previous approaches to autonomous agents often relied on simple heuristics and isolated environments, diverging from how humans actually learn. LLM-based agents aim to bridge this gap by leveraging comprehensive world knowledge.

c) A unified framework is proposed for constructing LLM-based autonomous agents, encompassing much of the prior work in this field. This provides a systematic way to design the agent architecture.

d) Enhancing agent capabilities is a key challenge, with strategies like fine-tuning the LLM or providing external knowledge/skills being explored.

e) LLM-based agents have diverse applications across social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering domains, showcasing their broad potential impact.

f) Evaluating LLM-based agents requires a combination of subjective (e.g. human judgments) and objective (e.g. task metrics) strategies to assess their performance comprehensively.

g) Several open challenges and future research directions are identified, indicating the field's rapid growth and areas for further innovation.


### Surprising/Shocking Elements


a) The rapid rise and widespread applications of LLM-based autonomous agents, which could potentially disrupt current AI systems and reshape human-machine interactions.

b) The proposed unified framework integrating different architectural components could contradict the perception that prior work was highly fragmented.

c) The notion that LLM-based agents can acquire human-like decision-making capabilities without extensive task-specific training data challenges conventional AI training paradigms.


### Key Quotes


"Autonomous agents have long been recognized as a promising approach to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is expected to accomplish tasks through self-directed planning and actions."

"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable successes, demonstrating significant potential to achieve human-like intelligence."

"Compared to reinforcement learning, LLM-based agents possess more comprehensive internal world knowledge, enabling them to perform informed actions even without training on specific domain data."

"In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents. We organize our survey around three key aspects: construction, application, and evaluation of LLM-based autonomous agents."

"For agent construction, we focus on two problems, that is, (1) how to design the agent architecture to better leverage LLMs, and (2) how to inspire and enhance the agent capability to complete different tasks."
