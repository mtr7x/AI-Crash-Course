Based on the provided paper, here are the key insights, surprising elements, and notable quotes:

Key Insights:

1. Mixtral 8x7B is a sparse mixture of experts language model that outperforms or matches larger models like Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across various benchmarks, particularly excelling in mathematics, code generation, and multilingual tasks.

2. By using a mixture of experts architecture, Mixtral has access to 47B parameters but only uses 13B active parameters during inference, allowing for faster inference speed and higher throughput.

3. Mixtral demonstrates the ability to successfully retrieve information from its large context window of 32k tokens, regardless of sequence length or information location.

4. The Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct model, fine-tuned to follow instructions, surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B on human evaluation benchmarks while exhibiting reduced biases.

5. The open release of Mixtral under the Apache 2.0 license ensures broad accessibility and potential for diverse applications.

Surprising Elements:

1. Mixtral's superior performance compared to larger models like Llama 2 70B, despite having a smaller active parameter count during inference.

2. The ability to effectively utilize a massive context window of 32k tokens, which is significantly larger than most language models.

3. The potential for a sparse mixture of experts architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance while offering computational advantages.

Notable Quotes:

1. "Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks."

2. "Mixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require multilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains."

3. "Experiments show that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens, regardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence."

4. "Its performance notably surpasses that of GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B – chat model on human evaluation benchmarks."

5. "Mixtral – Instruct also demonstrates reduced biases, and a more balanced sentiment profile in benchmarks such as BBQ, and BOLD."
