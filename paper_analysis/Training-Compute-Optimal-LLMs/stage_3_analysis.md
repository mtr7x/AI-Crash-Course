What's the Deal with Compute-Optimal LLMs? ðŸ¤”

Developers, listen up! This paper from the DeepMind team drops some serious knowledge about optimizing large language model training. The key insight? Most current LLMs like GPT-3 and Gopher are seriously undertrained relative to their model size. 

The researchers trained over 400 models of various sizes (up to 16B params) on different numbers of tokens (up to 400B). Their findings? For a fixed compute budget, you should scale the model size and training data equally. As in, if you double the model parameters, you should also double the number of training tokens.

This contrasts with the recent trend of just cramming more and more parameters into these LLMs while keeping the training data constant around 300B tokens. That's suboptimal, fam.

So what did they do? They trained a 70B param model called Chinchilla on 1.4T tokens - the same compute budget as the 280B Gopher but with way more training data. The results? Chinchilla outperformed Gopher, GPT-3, and other giants on a bunch of benchmarks while being way more compute-efficient for inference.

The implications? Smaller but longer-trained models could be the move for getting peak performance within realistic compute constraints. Devs working on LLM applications might want to prioritize optimizing for training tokens over just raw model size.

Of course, there's more nuance to unpack around data scale limits, batch sizes, etc. But this opens up an interesting new axis for ML researchers and practitioners to explore as we push the frontiers of what's possible with LLMs without going full Celestron on the compute costs.

Let's keep learning and building in public! What are your thoughts on this compute-optimal approach? Drop some knowledge in the comments ????
